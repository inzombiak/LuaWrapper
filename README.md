# LuaWrapper
A wrapper for Lua written in C++11. Work in progress.

As the title says, a mostly bug free lua wrapper. I've used it in [BeatHeroes](https://github.com/inzombiak/BeatHeroes) and [Material 2D](https://github.com/inzombiak/Material2D)

I wrote this following Jeremy Ong's blog posts on his Lua wrapper, [Selene](https://github.com/jeremyong/Selene). I have no idea why I didn't fork it back then (maybe something to do with the lack of \_ENV usage/usage of underscore functions?), but I'll try to get around to doing that at some point.
